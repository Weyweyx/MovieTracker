# Project-2: Movie Tracker

USER STORY:
AS a movie fanatic I WANT to make a list of movies that I want to watch SO THAT I can keep track of my movie bucket list as I watch them.

If you’re someone who loves watching movies and is looking for a website that will keep track of a self-made and user specific list of movies you plan to watch, this is the perfect website for you!

Having to remember all of the movies you’re anticipating to watch can be difficult, confusing, and tiresome, whether it’s a list in the notes app on your phone, a mental list or even a physical list. Ultimate Movie Tracker solves these problems, by offering a tool that keeps a log of the movies you plan on watching and the ones you have completed watching. A bucket list inspired functionality has made it possible for movie fanatics, keep track and be more organized with what films you want to watch and you even get to be your own critic of them if you choose to be!

Our goal was to create a website that had a fun yet useful purpose, one that could be used casually, all the while making life for avid movie watcher’s much easier! It's as simple as creating an account, or logging in for returning users, then you're ready to get started on that Watchlist!

In future development for Ultimate Movie Tracker, it would be amazing to include more personalized aspects and user-specific customization to a users profile, in order to make the experience more unique.
Another addition that has been discussed, is having friends between user accounts! If a user was able to friend another, they would then be able to see each others Watchlists and the corresponding notes/reviews!
One last future development includes, offering users to sort their movies by categories! This way, the films are easier to keep track of for the user, and because they would be the one deciding the categories, this will add to that unique user experience even more!

Some technologies used include: PostgreSQL, Express, Bulma CSS Framework, YouTube API
