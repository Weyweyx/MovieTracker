    <p class="custom-main-body">A haven among all movie fanatics and those
      alike, this is your place to achieve your movie watching goals! Keeping
      track of the movies you're anticipating to watch, whether the films
      haven't been released yet or you don't have the time to watch them yet,
      can be tricky. We are here to help solve those problems with Ultimate
      Movie Tracker! After creating an account, you will have full access to our
      amazing services. You will be able to have a "To-Do" styled Watchlist
      where you'll be prompted to enter in any movies of your choosing, and be
      able to add any notes for it if you wish. After watching any film provided
      on your Watchlist, feel free to checkmark it, marking it as "watched", and
      become a critic by adding your own review in the notes section! These
      lists are special and only for you, as only the account holder may see and
      modify their own Watchlist in anyway.
      <br />
      We are so happy you're here and excited to help you with such a fun
      activity! So what are you waiting for?! Go ahead and create an account and
      get started! Keep visitng back for future developer updates to add more to
      your experience! :D
